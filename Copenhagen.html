<h2>Absalon</h2>
</header>
<p>The first spot of my recomendations is a place called Absalon. This is an old church which was renovated and made to a kind of cafe. They also have board games, table tennis and much more. Throghout the month they arrange different events such as communal eating, yoga and garage sales. You can click the button bellow to learn more about absalon. <br>

<h3>Tivoli</h3>
</header>
<p>In Copenhagen we have quite a large amount of tourist attractions. For instance we have one of the worlds oldest amusementparks, which you can se a picture of to the left. It is called Tivoli, and is definately worth a visit. It was founded in 1843. It has many great and fun rides, but it is also a very beautiful place, and a nice place to take a walk. The only thing you should be aware of, is that it is quite expensive. </p>

<h3>The Little Mermaid</h3>
</header>
<p>Another great attraction is the little mermaid. It is located on "Langelinje. It is a sculpture that was made to illustrate a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen.  You can read more about the fairytale by clicking on the butten bellow. This is one of Denmarks greatest tourist attractions. It is very popular, and can be hard to come close to because of all the tourist, so if you want to see her. I think the best way is through one of Copenhagens many boat tours. You can se a picutre of her to the right. </p>

<h3>Broens Gadekøkken</h3> 											
</header>
<p>Broens Gadekøkken can be directly translated to "The street kitchen by the brigde" This is a place that is very ideal if you can agree on what to eat. It is shaped like a square where two of the sides are different kinds of street food. There is everything from Indian to Danish to Italien food. The middle is filled with benches and tables where you can enjoy your meal. The photo to the left shows one half side of the food booths. </p>
