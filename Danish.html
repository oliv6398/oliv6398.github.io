<p>The Danish culture - from a Danish perspective
To be danish, is a term, which can mean different things to people. To help understanding the term a bit better, and to learn other people's point of view, I asked around to get some opinions. </p>

<h2>Passport and Willingness</h2>
</header>
<p>You are Danish when you have a Danish passport and citizenship. That is how most Danes would define the term. When I asked the people I met, that was the answer I got the most and the quickest, but after a little while, most people started to reflect a bit more. A group of girls i met, agreed on, that you are danish, if you participate in the culture. <br>

<h3>Doubt</h3>
</header>
<p>I continued talking to young Danes. When I asked the question "What does it mean to be danish" I was met with doubt from a lot of people. They had difficulties defining the term. After some time one of the people started to talk. He thought that it is a challenging topic to talk about, because it is your birthright and therefore you don’t talk or even think about it in your everyday life. Meanwhile the others in the group nodded with agreement. </p>

<h3>Nordic Values</h3>
</header>
<p>My last interview was with a Danish middle-aged woman and she had another perspective. She defined Danish culture more by the Christian and Nordic values such as Christmas, empathy and the Danish term “hygge”
Hygge is phrase, which is used by all Danes. It is a very special word because it doesn’t have a translation to any other language. It can mean cozy, but it’s also used to describe a situation, or it can be used as a verb. 
The woman also said that we can choose what part of the Danish culture we want to be a part of.  </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3> 											
</header>
<p>Although all of my sources said something completely different from each other, they all agreed on one thing: 
Culture is undefinable. It is your culture. It is your decision. That leads me to my defination. <br>
In my opion, the danish culture is a lot of things. It is our traditions, our sense of humor and our way to look past our differences. 
To understand the dansih culture, you don't need to know everything about the history and the language before you get here, you just need to be open minded and ready to learn.  </p>
